<% provide(:title, "contact") %>

andersan@umich.edu??? or another way, to stop spam??


got it

do i need a contact page AND an about page??? 
- if the website is not JUST a professional portfolio (e.g. has poetry) then it could be appropriate

- maybe doesn't make sense to have a non-professional portfolio?
