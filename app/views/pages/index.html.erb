<h2>my dev environment</h2>
<p class="column" style="float:none;">since november 2014, my main computer has been a toshiba chromebook 2, which i must say is a fantastic machine! all of my developing work has been done on linux through a dual-boot system called crouton which is specific to chrome OS. i am currently dual-booting an ubuntu 14.04 unity desktop and the standard chrome OS. this has provided some challenges (especially with photo editing software), but the system is fast enough for the projects i have done and i am now very comfortable working from the command line on a linux machine.</p>
