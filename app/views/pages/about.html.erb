<h3 style="clear: both;">web development skills </h2>

<p class="twelve columns offset-by-two">i enjoy working with MVC web frameworks like rails and django and would love to learn node.js. i have taken three computer science classes, one of which was specific to web dev, and have completed a thorough ruby on rails tutorial. my portfolio is fairly representative of my skillset (although most of the projects were in collaboration with teams). </p>



<p class="twelve columns offset-by-two">it is important to note that my name does not have anything to do with the First Nation Cree People, but is a nickname some friends use to refer to me. any miscommunication caused by this is regrettable and i encourage you to contact me if you take issue with this naming of my web page.</p> 

<p class="twelve columns offset-by-two">if you would like to contact me for a freelance project or any other reason, send an email to andersan@umich.edu!</p>
